# Mondrian

Proc generated puzzle prototype for [gmtk 2020](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020), sparkled by classic game [Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)).

GMTK's theme is "Out of Control", where you have side effects when click on a cube, that affects all cubes that link to it as well. Click on a cube to change its color, align all cubes to the same color to clear level. When you correctly align colors between paired cubes, you'll see the link established.
